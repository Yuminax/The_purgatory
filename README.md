# The_purgatory
The purgatory is a school project. This game has a page on my itch.io https://doriantan.itch.io/the-purgatory

This project was made during the 3rd year lesson on infographics tools, specifically using Unity. It represents the space between life and death, where one must face their worst fears while also going through the 5 stages of grief. Each scene represents one of the stages.

The Purgatory represents the judgment a person goes through to find out whether he deserves Heaven or Hell.

The player has just died, and must now be judged for his actions during life. He will therefore pass through five rooms, representing the five phases of mourning, before ascending to his new life. He must collect one artifact per room to complete the ritual that will allow him to ascend.
